<p><a href="http://web.me.com/stefsewell/TechEd2010/">Stef</a> and I are presenting the 5:45 slot tomorrow in the Marlborough room at <a href="http://newzealand.msteched.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Tech Ed NZ</a>. The subject of the talk is <a href="http://newzealand.msteched.com/topic/details/DEV404#showdetails" target="_blank">Hardcore Workflow</a> , basically a list of hurdles we had to overcome to implement enterprise workflow.</p>
<p>I’ll post the slides and code in the next few days.</p>
