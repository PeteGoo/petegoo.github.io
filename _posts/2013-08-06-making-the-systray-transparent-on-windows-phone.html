<p>I’ve used a semi-transparent AppBar on windows phone a number of times to get the visual effect I wanted and to stop the dreaded jumping frame when transitioning pages but I didn’t think it would be possible with the SysTray. Turns out that the SysTray in Windows Phone can be made transparent.</p>
<p>This is pretty useful if you want to keep an image background that spans the entire height of the screen. Simply add the attributes below to your root PhoneApplicationPage element.</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">
shell:SystemTray.IsVisible="True"
shell:SystemTray.ForegroundColor="Yellow"
shell:SystemTray.Opacity="0"
</pre>
<p>and the result should look like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-424" alt="systray" src="/images/2013/08/systray1-300x94.png" width="300" height="94" /></p>
