<p>I’ll be speaking at the North Shore .Net users group on 18th November details below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Workflow Services</strong></p>
<p>This talk will focus on the what, why and how of workflow services. We will discuss the runtime architecture of workflows, persistence, tracking, on-premise hosting in IIS and Windows Server AppFabric and how you can leverage these out-of-the-box features to build scalable, reliable services which support long-running human-based processes with ease.<br />
