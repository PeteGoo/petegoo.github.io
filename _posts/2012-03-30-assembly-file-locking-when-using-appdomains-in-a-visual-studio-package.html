<p>Recently I was using a new AppDomain from within a Visual Studio package to reflect over a dll and get some metadata. I then unloaded the AppDomain expecting that the file locks on the dll file would be released…..but they weren’t.</p>
<p>I could see that another AppDomain in VS was holding a lock on my file. You can see this by switching on Native debugging when attaching another visual studio instance and from the immediate window use:</p>
<blockquote><p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">.load sos</font></p>
<p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">!dumpdomain</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this is due to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomainsetup.loaderoptimization(v=vs.80).aspx" target="_blank">LoaderOptimization</a> attribute. Set this property to SingleDomain on your AppDomainSetup object to allow the file lock to be freed when unloading your AppDomain. This translates as.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Indicates that the application will probably have a single domain, and loader must not share internal resources across application domains. </em></p>
</blockquote>
