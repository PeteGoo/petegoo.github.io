<p>The Microsoft Patterns and Practices team have just released Enterprise Library 3.0 - April 2007. This is the full RTM version of EntLib with some really neat new features:</p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validation Application Block.</strong> Allows you to centrally define validation rules using configuration or attributes, and easily validate data from anywhere in your application, including deep integration with Windows Forms, ASP.NET and WCF. </li>
<li><strong>Policy Injection Application Block.</strong> Provides a powerful approach for separating cross-cutting concerns from business logic using declarative policies that are attached at runtime to methods on your objects. </li>
<li><strong>Application Block Software Factory.</strong> Dramatically simplifies the process of building application blocks and providers through the magic of guidance automation. </li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio-integrated Configuration Editor.</strong> Edit Enterprise Library configuration files directly within Visual Studio. </li>
<li><strong>Environmental Overrides.</strong> Use the configuration tool to specify configuration settings that are common or different across multiple environments, and merge this information into configuration files to be deployed with your applications. </li>
<li><strong>WCF Integration.</strong> Easily integrate the Logging, Exception Handling and Validation Application Blocks into service interfaces built using Windows Communication Foundation. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-compiled, strong-named binaries.</strong> No need to compile and strong name the code unless you want to manage and evolve the code yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a play with the Visual Studio integration and Environmental Overrides functionality over the weekend (yeh, I know) - I'm glad they eventually added this stuff in. Olaf Conijn was building these as add ons before he was assimilated.</p>
