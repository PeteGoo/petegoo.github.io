<p>I've been using this plugin now for the past few months. You would not believe the difference it makes.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><em>This plugin puts a little search box right into Visual Studio to make it easy to find work items.  It is an addin for Team Foundation Client (Team Explorer) and is accessible from the Team menu when you're connected to a Team Foundation Server and is also avalible from a VS Toolbar.  You just type in some search text and it runs a work item query for you showing you results across the work item store.</em></span></p>
