<p>In using the <a title="MSDN DataContractJsonSerializer" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.json.datacontractjsonserializer.aspx" target="_blank">DataContractJsonSerializer</a> beware of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412170.aspx#" target="_blank">DateTime instances</a> which have been instantiated as non-UTC. If you declare without explicitly assigning a DateTime you get the same as <em>default(DateTime)</em>, this is 01/01/01 00:00:00 (0 ticks) with a DateTimeKind of <em>Unspecified</em>. When the DataContractJsonSerializer looks at this value (or a Local datetime), it will try to convert it to UTC by subtracting the time zone ala UTC standard notation, this results in a date time that is less that 0 ticks and an out of range exception if you are west of GMT.</p>
<p>The solution is to always instantiate as UTC and you can avoid this issue. As <a href="/2009/03/17/wcf-collections-with-payload-via-surrogates.aspx" target="_blank">mentioned previously</a> you cannot interrupt the serialization process for DateTime on a member of the DataContract serializer family.</p>
<p>Another pain in the rectum is that it will change the accuracy of your DateTime value from 100 ns to 1 ms, so if you are relying on this value being the same for change tracking or any other means then this will produce problems.</p>
