<p>There are many heated discussions on the overuse of var and I'm not going to repeat the arguments here. Personally, I have no problem with var used in the declaration of a variable where the value is instantiated inline via a constructor, anything else (apart from LINQ) seems dangerous. Having said that, the following sample I came across today is simply stupid.</p>
<p>var controller = new MyController().GetValueX(foo);</p>
