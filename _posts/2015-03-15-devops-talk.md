On February 19th I [gave a talk at the Auckland.Net meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AKL-NET/events/220001017/) titled "Devops for the .Net Developer". The idea of this talk was to present the context that gave rise to the DevOps movement, outlining it's drivers, principles and guiding practices and then frame all of this in terms that apply to the average .Net development shop. In other words, sharing a lot of the knowledge I have gained over the last year working in the DevOps space.

I think it was pretty well received. Below are the slides from that talk.
