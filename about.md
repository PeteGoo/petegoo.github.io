My name is Peter Goodman, I am a developer living in Auckland, New Zealand building software for the legal industry. My hometown is Londonderry in Northern Ireland and I spent about 6 years in Edinburgh, Scotland working in the financial sector before moving to New Zealand in 2007.

I specialise in Microsoft .Net, Domain Driven Design, DSL Tools Windows Communication Foundation and Workflow Foundation. I have spoken at Tech-Ed New Zealand on Workflow and Windows Server AppFabric as well as various meetups and community groups.
