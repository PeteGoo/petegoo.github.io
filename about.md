My name is Pete Goodman, I am a software engineer and leader living in Auckland building products and teams. Originally from Derry, Northern Ireland, I spent about 6 years in Edinburgh, Scotland working in the financial sector before moving to New Zealand in 2007 where I worked for various software companies and startups. Lately I've been a VP of Engineering at [Pushpay](http://pushpay.com).

I find myself thinking about how to build effective, motivated teams. I have spoken at conferences on Blameless Culture, DevOps, AWS, SRE, and Engineering Leadership.

You can find my talks and slides referenced on my main web site at [petegoo.com](http://www.petegoo.com)
